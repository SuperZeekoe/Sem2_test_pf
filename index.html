              <p>
                For interactive media my main focus the past few weeks has been
                to find iterations I’ve worked on, and showcase those here to
                finish my learning outcome. I have previously worked on multiple
                iterations but haven’t shown them enough. Something that came up
                after a small talk with Amer was that I’ves worked on multiple
                iterations with the project’s Figma design. Because of feedback
                I’ve implemented changes to our first prototype in the form of
                general layout changes, specific element design and navbar
                layout.

                In terms of my portfolio, I’ve changed a few things over the
                course of the semester. The biggest iteration has been making it
                a one-pager. Another smaller, more user-friendly change, has
                been adding a little back-icon around my logo to showcase to the
                users how to go back to previous “pages”. <br />-See image
                above.
              </p>
              <p>
                Besides iterations, for UCD I’ve worked on a heuristic
                evaluation of the prototype I previously created for the
                project. It was a bit hard to completely fill it in because of
                the questions asked, and what I’ve created did not align most of
                the time. Besides that I helped form the survey questions and
                did some rough storyboarding for our videography assignment.
                However I’ve mostly been busy with the prototyping for the
                project these past few weeks and implementing research results
                into it.

                Our client gave us feedback after showing him 6 different
                prototypes and from there I combined all the things he liked
                into one prototype. Keeping what worked from each in order to
                accommodate his wishes, while keeping the functionality intact.
                But most of it came down to combining two prototypes, with few
                minor details from others. I’ve mostly kept my navigation bar
                and footer, and added Melany’s main design.<br /><br />-See

              <h2>Previous evaluation work</h2>
              <p>
                There has been a relatively short period of time between last
                evaluation and this one so we haven’t done too much in regards
                to some learning outcomes. We got one assignment to recreate a
                page in Figma (linked below). I dive deeper into that assignment
                on that page. Besides that I haven’t worked on my personal
                designs. My designs are fairly set in stone for the time being,
                mostly functionality improvements are being made at the moment.
                I’m trying to create a more fluent experience for users. One key
                thing I wish to implement next is a horizontal scrolling feature
                on the front page, so the user won’t have to use their mouse to
                click and drag.
              </p>
              <p>
                The feedback from Amer is not lost on me, just hard to take it
                and turn it into something concrete at the moment. I have a few
                more ideas to make it more user friendly, one being a little
                addition to my logo (return button), to include a small curving
                arrow to showcase it as a “back” button officially. This is
                something I wish to implement next iteration.

                Development this last part of the semester has been rough for
                me. I feel like I can reasonably work with JSON and JavaScript
                after the previous evaluation. However adding new ideas to my
                current existing portfolio has been troublesome. The initial
                idea I had for adding a horizontal scrolling function has been
                really hard to implement alongside my drag and drop style
                navigation. It seems to conflict with each other. After getting
                some working prototypes of horizontal scrolling with the help of
                google, implementing that together with my click & drag style of
                movement, it breaks everything and I haven’t been able to find a
                fix for it. I think it has to do with the way the html is
                structured and what my existing code uses as elements to
                manipulate.

              <h2>Previous Evaluation work</h2>
              <p>
                For development we got a few more assignments over the past few
                weeks. These were mostly based on outside of html data usage. We
                got started with JSON dummy data, and grabbing the elements we
                want out of said file and loading it in on our html page, all
                with JavaScript. This went fairly well, after initially
                struggling a bit. The next addition to this assignment was to
                replace the JSON dummy data, and implement our Project Group
                member names in there and creating a “Meet the Team” page. This
                was fairly simple, although my code is a bit barebones and
                simple. I know there probably is a better and cleaner way of
                doing it but I’m not yet sure how to.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next up was replacing the JSON file with an API. I decided to
                choose a few different APIs, and try to change multiple aspects
                of my page based on what API you’d choose to click on and call
                on. I got three image generators, a trump tweet collection API
                and a random advice API. I managed to get the image generators
                changing the img src into a single line of code using JavaScript
                or operators. I was quite proud of that one (even though it’s
                pretty simple). <br />For more information on the JSON and API
                assignments, please click the button below.

              <p>
                In terms of design, we’ve been mostly busy on the videography
                assignment. This was the one I was looking forward to the most.
                I really like movies and storytelling and being able to combine
                the two for a school project, getting to work with amazing
                equipment and fun people is the perfect combination. Luckily for
                me, my group consists of Rob, Luc and Yvonne. Luc and Yvonne
                both have extensive experience working in film, Luc from high
                school and Yvonne from her previous education. So I knew I was
                in good hands if I were to have questions. <br /><br />For more

              <p>
                For this learning outcome I feel like we haven’t done too much
                lately. <br />
                The main thing I feel like we’ve done is creating a magazine
                layout based on specifications provided. This was a really fun
                assignment during class, although a bit stressful with the time
                constraints. I feel like we as a group were quite creative,
                breaking standard layout norms. This could obviously be a
                negative thing depending on how you look at it, but for my
                personally I like thinking outside of the box.
                <br />

              <p>
                I also got started on photography for this learning outcome.
                It's mostly just been trying to figure out how the camera works
                and what different settings do the pictures. So far I've tried
                capturing a few hidden faces and try my hand at some DOF shots
                as well as some waterfall shots.

                For this learning outcome most of it comes from either UCD or
                the Project.
              </p>
              <h3>Project</h3>
              <p>
                Lately on the project part of Research I’ve mostly done
                iteration work regarding the prototype. I did some minor survey
                work, creating the initial layout, where the rest of the group
                finished it. I was also the person who read the final report in
                it’s entirety, checking it thoroughly. I also used the results
                of the survey, A/B testing and interviews to create a final
                prototype. Obviously always checking with the group if the
                changes I made were up to expectations. Besides that I’ve taken
                notes of a meeting with our client, keeping track of their
                wishes and trying to keep it concise enough to iterate upon.
              </p>

              <h3>UCD</h3>
              <p>
                The Project work mostly comes back into the UCD assignment these
                past few weeks. As it’s been a group assignment and we have a
                large group (8), we split up the work. I mainly used the
                resulting data from the A/B testing, interviews and feedback
                from the client to create a final prototype version. This is the
                version we’ve near perfectly followed when creating the actual
                website, making minor adjustments on the go.

              <h2>Previous evaluation reflections</h2>
              <p>
                The past few weeks we basically just compiled the research data
                we gathered previously.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’ve put this into a presentation and also compiled it into a
                research document. The feedback we received on both of these
                were quite enlightening, we should get more to the point
                quickly, so the stakeholder interested can easily find which
                part apply to them.<br />

                Communication ties mostly into the project. I’ve mainly been
                trying to keep in contact with our group as much as possible
                with whatever we have to do. Making sure everyone is aligned
                with their expectations going forward and working together
                towards our shared goal. During meetings and presentations I
                have either taken notes, or joined others in taking combined
                notes. Generally this learning outcome for me mostly means
                trying to make sure the group work, communication and cohesion
                stays intact.

              <h3>Previous evaluation reflection</h3>
              <p>This learning outcome links back to ‘Research’ mostly.</p>
              <p>
                We compiled our previously done research and created a
                presentation and report to showcase said data to our
                stakeholders. We’re currently in the process of setting up
                another meeting with the client as well to communicate our
                findings back to him in order to get an idea of how our next
                steps should be taken in the prototyping phase.

              <h3>Evaluation 3 reflection</h3>
              <p>
                As a first year ICT & Media Design student I feel like I have
                progressed significantly. After not having studied for over 10
                years, only having started last year and quitting after 6
                months, it’s not been easy. But after having found the profile
                Media Design I feel confident going forward. I always try to
                stay on top of things and keep professional in my handling of
                school work (while of course having a laugh any chance I get).
              </p>
              <p>
                In group work I tend to start off as a bit of a leader trying to
                keep focus and make sure things go according to plan, but I tend
                to drop that role once I notice things are progressing without
                my directions or input. I know from experience that group work
                and new social contacts are inherently difficult at the start,
                especially while having to communicate with people you don’t
                know. I try to break that part at the start by trying to keep
                the objectives clear. I hope I succeed in doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
                In communication with classmates and teachers I try to be as
                professional as possible while also keeping it casual. Keeping
                it casual obviously only works depending on the setting, and I
                think Fontys is the perfect place for that.
              </p>
              <p>
                In summary I tend to be a somewhat controlling person, wanting
                to know what is going on, at what time, and what is expected of
                me and whatever group I’m in. I am able to let this controlling
                part of me go a bit once I’ve gathered insights into the goings
                of the group and timeline of the projects. I don’t see this as
                an inherently bad part of me though, as long as it doesn’t cause
                me stress. Being on top of things is one of my strong suits I’d
                say. Keeping communication lines shorts and staying in touch
                with group members is very important in my opinion.
              </p>

              <h3>Previous evaluation reflection</h3>
              <p>
                For this last learning outcome I think my portfolio progress
                somewhat speaks for itself. I try to improve upon my previous
                ideas and add increasing functionalities and provide a better
                user experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Now I must say, I’m not yet done and there are always things to
                improve but I like the progress I’ve made so far. A main part I
                wish to improve upon next evaluation is to shorten my JavaScript
                code. Currently there are a bunch of repeat functions and
                eventlisteners for similar things. There probably is a more
                compact, cleaner way of doing things, but I have not yet figured
                out how to do that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together with the next task of delivering a photo book
                containing photos I’ve taken myself I hope to prove my portfolio
                and photography portfolio is sufficient in proving I’ve
                completed this learning outcome. But for now, I personally am
                happy with my progress.

                In general, this project for me has been about group
                communication, collaboration, separation of tasks and managing
                people. Initially my role was more of a leadership role, which I
                toned down slightly halfway through the semester because it was
                clear to me that the group could work just as well, if everyone
                did their own things without someone assigning things. In the
                end my role was more of a designer, coder, and being an editor
                on the reports. I did some research too, mostly in the form of
                surveys and competitive analysis.<br />For the final report
                there wasn’t much need for the editing part however.
              </p>
              <p>
                As mentioned previously these last few weeks my task was the
                design, making sure it was done according to all the research
                and feedback received, from users and the client. Before our
                final meeting with the client I collected our group members’
                individual prototypes and combined these into a single file for
                easy showcasing. During the meeting with the client I was
                writing down his and our teacher’s feedback on our designs and
                proceedings, as well as general feedback on our interview.

                For the final report I did not write anything new. The content
                of me that is in there has been written previously in the
                project plan or in research documents and copied over into the
                appropriate places in the final report.

              <h3>Previous evaluation reflection</h3>
              <p>By request of Metaxas, a dedicated project page.</p>
              <p>
                For the most part the project the past few weeks has been about
                compiling and showcasing the data we’ve gathered in the weeks
                prior. <br />
                We created a presentation with compiled data in it, and after
                finding out we had to make a compiled research document, we made
                one on short notice. I’m quite proud of the quick work we did on
                the latter. The feedback we received was to the point and makes
                sense, we’ll make sure to utilize this in the upcoming phases of
                the project.
                <br />For more information on the work over the past few weeks,

            <h1>About</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                Hey, I'm Tim. <br /><br />
                Currently a Media-Design student at FHICT in Eindhoven. I'm a
                somewhat creative, sometimes chaotic, but always curious person.
                I always have the highest expectations of myself, although that
                sometimes gets me nowhere. As a perfectionist I'm always trying
                to improve myself and my work. <br /><br />
                I have learned however to somewhat lessen the expectations I put
                on myself.
                <br />
                This is the second (third..?) portfolio I've created this year
                but I intend to stick with this design for now and work at bit
                by bit.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a big fan of anything sci-fi. Whether it be movies, shows or
                games, I love it all.
                <br />
                I mostly play games on PC, though I do have a PS5 for those
                sweet exclusive titles.
                <br /><br />
                Cycling is my main hobby and sport I'd say, when the weather is
                nice I'd like to ride almost daily. I'm also a big fan of
                fitness, I try to go to the gym at least 3 times a week.

            <h1>Figma Recreation</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                As a practical assignment for UCD, we got the task to recreate a
                webpage one to one in Figma. This assignment felt right up my
                alley. I’ve been using Figma since semester 1 as Josh showed it
                to us as a helpful tool. I’ve been already using Figma as part
                of my design process for my portfolio and whatever design task
                we have. The design for the assignment was fairly
                straightforward. I even managed to get most of the images one to
                one. Only thing that is slightly off, is the screen size as my
                frame is 1920x1080, and the source image provided looked more
                like a tablet screen, which would be slightly wider. <br />I
                somewhat managed to scale things appropriately. All in all it
                didn’t take too long. I feel very comfortable using Figma. I did
                learn some new things though, such as plugins for icons.
                Generally I find it a very neat tool to use and can very quickly
                create decent looking designs. I haven’t worked too much on
                transitions and high fidelity prototypes yet. I did some
                mid-fidelty prototypes for my portfolio however.

            <h1>User Scenario Recording</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                During a day I was not at school because I wasn’t feeling well
                my project group created user scenarios with the help of
                Chat-GPT. Last Tuesday (18-04-2023) we were tasked in creating a
                video for the user scenario to see how it would play out. I
                personally set up the camera and recorded together with Aadira,
                and I also did the voice-over for the video. The editing after
                was done by Yvonne and Luc. I did some very bad voice acting for
                the voice-over in a terrible southern American accent and a very
                terrible Scottish one in there for a bit of a mix-up.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing I did learn afterwards, after hearing the fully edited
                version again, was that I did the voice recording from the side.
                Which ruined the sound balance having it more favoured to the
                right speakers. The video recording itself was fine. We managed
                to get the angle and focus right pretty easily.

            <h1>JSON + API Assignments</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                During development we got started with JSON. Initially we had
                dummy data that we had to grab and showcase on an empty html
                page. It wasn’t the easiest at the start but I managed to get it
                working decently well. The data grabbing and creating HTML
                elements with JavaScript may not have been the cleanest but for
                now it does the trick.
              </p>
              <p>
                An added extra assignment to go further with JSON was to change
                JSON data to an API. Rob sent me a GitHub link with a list of
                hundreds of different APIs. I decided to add a few random image
                generators, a random tweet generator and a random advice
                generator. I tried to get an API that would get stock advice but
                I couldn’t get it to work. I asked some friends who gave me some
                tips and changed some headers and I had some CORS issues. When
                even they (who’ve worked in IT for years) couldn’t get it to
                work, I shelved the idea. Because if smarter people than me
                can’t figure it out, I surely can’t (After trying for a few
                hours).

            <h1>Magazine Layout Creation</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                A little fun assignment we got for Media Production was to
                create a magazine layout based on some specifics provided. This
                was supposed to be somewhat of a simulation to work by the
                requirements of a company. Luc and I seemed to have the same
                idea, of diagonal lines with images cutting through the text
                somewhat. I’m not sure what else to write about this. We tried
                to be as creative as possible and don’t stick to the basic norms
                and visuals of a magazine.
              </p>

                The end result kind of gave some 90s vibe. The overall structure
                was nice, but since we cut out some spaces from the
                advertisement areas, that could be some advertisers and
                companies trying to advertise would not like. Advertisements
                generally have their own dimensions and if we cut out some parts
                for design reasons, we might cut out important parts of the ad
                those companies paid for.

            <h1>Photography</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                Currenty I've been working hard on the photobook for
                Photography. It's nearing completion although I'm not 100%
                satisfied with everything yet. There are some photo's I'd like
                better ones of, like background compression. But for now I think
                they encapsulate the effect reasonably well.
                <br />
                A bit of reflection on this assignment so far. I feel like I
                have learned quite a bit about photography, but it's still hard
                for me to decide when to use what settings. For a lot of things
                I feel like the basic 'Landscape' or 'Portrait' modes can do the
                trick. But I'm trying to get more into the manual settings. The
                photography part itself has been the most fun so far, the
                specific assignments and requirements have been a bit of a drag.
                I understand why they are there though, if we were to get a job
                including photography we'd have to work by the requirements of
                the client. So I've tried my best to work by the requirements
                and still make something I'm proud of.
                <br />
                The designing of the photobook was interesting, I wasn't really
                sure what to go for. In the end I decided to bring back the
                colours of my logo and my portfolio to show some continuation.
                I've tried to keep it fairly minimalistic and clean. Also with a
                bit of inspiration from Mondriaan, a Dutch painter.
                <br />
                Below you will find a link to a Google Drive containting the
                photos I've used, including the text draft. As well as a button
                to the PDF version of the photobook.

              <h2>Previous photography documentation</h2>
              <p>
                I’ve taken a few quick photo’s to showcase something. It’s not
                much as I’m currently still figuring out how my camera works (I
                managed to borrow one from my sister). I kind of got the basics
                down but managing the different settings on the camera for
                different outcomes in photographs is something I’m not yet
                confident in. <br />Currently I’m also in the process of trying
                to create photos for the ‘Waterfall’ task. I have a quite busy
                parking lot across the street from me, with a lot of moving
                lights from cars driving by. All I need is the right moment for
                the shot.
              </p>
              <p>
                I’ve been posted behind my window for a few hours and taking
                some pictures during that time, but for the most part it was too
                light outside for the waterfall task properly. I managed to get
                a few decent-ish shots. After that I tried my hand at taking a
                picture of the moon, which somewhat worked. I also tried my hand
                at taking a picture of the stars but that proved a bit harder
                since I have no idea how to get the focus right when you
                yourself can’t see anything. Please check out my initial
                attempts below.
              </p>

                For our project we had to do a little recap presentation,
                showcasing our research results. Together with Rob and Aadira, I
                would be presenting. I went over the competitive analysis
                results, since I created that together with Luc. It was just a
                generalisation of what we’d find out and what our potential USP
                could be.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also the person who did approximately 90% of the work on
                the presentation visuals, layout and content. So the feedback we
                got was mostly applicative to me. Metaxas’ main feedback was to
                not put too many words on a slide and don’t make
                images/screenshots/text too small. We also had a slide for a
                chart, which could’ve been conveyed instead on a slide with
                words and digits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Something most groups missed, including ours, was to create a
                convincing story about how the personas we created are relevant
                to the research we conducted. We should be basing personas off
                of the data we collect and think of them as a relative so we can
                talk about them at any moment. In addition to that, we should
                state hard facts, and show what pieces of data we based our
                persona off of.

            <h1>Presentation</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                For our project we had to do a little recap presentation,
                showcasing our research results. Together with Rob and Aadira, I
                would be presenting. I went over the competitive analysis
                results, since I created that together with Luc. It was just a
                generalisation of what we’d find out and what our potential USP
                could be.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was also the person who did approximately 90% of the work on
                the presentation visuals, layout and content. So the feedback we
                got was mostly applicative to me. Metaxas’ main feedback was to
                not put too many words on a slide and don’t make
                images/screenshots/text too small. We also had a slide for a
                chart, which could’ve been conveyed instead on a slide with
                words and digits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Something most groups missed, including ours, was to create a
                convincing story about how the personas we created are relevant
                to the research we conducted. We should be basing personas off
                of the data we collect and think of them as a relative so we can
                talk about them at any moment. In addition to that, we should
                state hard facts, and show what pieces of data we based our
                persona off of.

            <section>
              <p>
                During week 9 we apparently had to showcase a research report to
                Metaxas, but our group missed the memo. So over the span of
                about 1,5 hours we created one, so we could still show our
                research to Metaxas.
              </p>
              <p>
                I quickly made a document setup and got to work on compiling the
                Survey data. The content I wrote was approved by Metaxas and he
                liked it. The main piece of feedback he gave that was applicable
                to everything in our document was to have a summary and a
                conclusion, so stakeholders could quickly skim the document and
                pick the to them important pieces at a glance and if they’re
                interested, read more in the main piece of content.

            <h1>First JSON test</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                For our first use of JSON we had to put initial dummy JSON dummy
                data on a list in html without any existing html to support it.
                This upgraded to eventually changing the JSON data to our own
                inputs. It started off a bit tough, but in the end I managed to
                get my JSON data printed, with the selected data I chose to
                show. There isn’t really any styling as that wasn’t part of the
                assignment. I tried a few different approaches, but in the end I
                went with the “simpler” approach.
              </p>
              <p>
                I did learn how to grab JSON data properly though and how to
                manipulate HTML with JavaScript through this assignment. During
                the summer I want to get started on a little portfolio project
                where I grab my website content from a JSON file instead of
                having to put it into HTML.

                Frank gave us a tiny assignment to find something cool from
                caniuse.com and try to create something funny or neat with it. I
                chose to play with some animations and using it move in headers.
                I feel like I created quite a fancy looking intro page for our
                project client, although we’re never going to use it. It’s
                nothing much, but for an intro page I feel like it could work
                quite nicely if implemented well.

            <h1>"Crap" to-do list</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                Next assignment that was more of a bigger JavaScript assignment,
                was the “Crap-to-do-list”. The objective was to create a
                functioning to-do list with JavaScript, no matter what the code
                or styling looks like. Because Frank called it a “Crap” to-do
                list, I chose to go with a slightly juvenile approach of styling
                it after “poop”.
              </p>
              <p>
                I had a few initial versions that worked slightly, but with the
                help of Rob it came together quite quickly as he’s pretty good
                at this stuff. It seems I have the tendency to overthink these
                coding challenges and make things too hard for myself initially,
                as my first thought went to using JSON for the list. That was a
                bit too much which I spent too much time on unnecessarily.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the end it simply creates a 'li' element underneath the
                chosen #id after an Event Listener. The 'li' element contains
                the data entered in another text box which gets read out after
                clicking the same event listener.

            <h1>Project Coding</h1>
            <section>
              <p>
                For the project we separated our tasks. I ended up with the
                “About Me” page, shared effort on the “Cart” page with Yvonne,
                and the general Footer. The footer took about 20 minutes to
                make, being a near exact copy of the prototype design.
              </p>
              <p>
                The “About me” page was equally simple. Since I created the
                design I immediately had ideas on how to create every single
                page, so no matter which one I got assigned, I knew how to
                tackle it. I ended up going with a simple window width 'hero'
                element, and a flexbox approach to two even positioned 'div'
                elements to separate the profile image and description.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the “Cart” page it was a bit more difficult, as we initially
                didn’t have a cart page design. I quickly created a very rough
                draft to give us an idea on how to start coding it. I created
                the initial base layout with minimal styling and gave the rest
                to Yvonne for further improvements and eventually to Rob for
                functionality.
              </p>
              <p>
                What I learned most from this part of the project in terms of
                coding is that creating clear designs can give you clear
                directions going forward with the actual creation of a product.
                Since for me the front-end part of the coding was my job, I made
                sure that having a clear design was the way to go. Not having
                over complicated positions and structuring is something I’m
                working on going forward with my designs, as previously I have
                wanted to create more intricate things which in the end proved
                difficult to work on.

                My portfolio has been a thorn in my side every since the first
                evaluation. Once again I shot myself in my foot, trying to
                create something innovative and interesting compared to the
                standard layouts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following the initial tutorial for the click & drag navigation
                on the homepage (which didn’t even work and I had to tweak some
                things, thanks HyperPlexed), I wanted to make it a one-pager,
                having only vertical movement upon clicking certain elements.
                The JavaScript for this proved quite simple. The way how I did
                it though, with the amount of content I have, is extremely
                inefficient and looks very messy (although it’s quite clear). It
                is just a ton of repeat commands changing elements on every
                other element overlayed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Functionally, it’s pretty much there as I had in mind. The
                layout of the lower blocks is a bit limited though because of
                the window size, creating large pieces of content easily gets
                messy and cramped. Especially trying to add images is rough this
                way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next semester, I will not be shooting myself in the foot with
                such grand ideas, rather keeping a simple layout but
                implementing more little nifty things instead. Making sure I
                have lots of space for content and places to tweak and play with
                instead of blocking myself of creativity in my existing design.

                David Attenborough’s nature documentaries.

                From there on we started creating a list of what we needed.
                Yvonne and Luc mostly did that part as they have previous
                experience working on video assignments and filming/editing in
                general. We asked for special permission to use the DJI Ronin
                4D. A surprisingly simple to use camera once you know what
                everything does. We also got access to the Media Lab and
                wireless microphones to capture sound. We did some rough
                storyboarding the same day, sketching a quick image of what we
                wanted to shoot the first day. We came to the conclusion that I
                am terrible at drawing.

                The next day we got started on filming in the Media Lab. From
                here on out I’ve mostly been the production assistant, lead
                actor and occasionally coming up with ideas of shots. At times
                I’ve also tried to keep everything going as I noticed things
                were starting to slow down a bit due to the weather getting
                warmer and days getting longer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second filming day we once again gathered everything and met
                up at the Media Lab to organize for the day. This was more of an
                indoor shooting day, so we started filming around the different
                profiles, memeing a bit on each of them and intentionally
                forgetting infrastructure, because that’s not a real profile
                anyway.
              </p>

                Next Monday we got started on editing. Yvonne already did the
                most of it. Because I don’t want to interrupt Luc and Yvonne’s
                work, I asked for the footage too, so I could get started with
                Adobe Premiere Pro myself. Trying to creating a small blooper
                reel, collecting funny clips and sounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                We didn’t have too many bloopers shot as we mostly stopped
                rolling as soon as a take wasn’t good. So there wasn’t too much
                funny footage to work with, but with some creative freedom and
                copyright free music I created a short clip.
