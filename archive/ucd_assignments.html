        <h1>UCD Assignments</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            A few assignments we received for UCD were to create some short
            presentations on different subjects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first presentation was focussed around our own personal views on
            our future regarding UCD, as well as finding some examples of good
            and bad website designs. I feel like my future in UCD lies mainly
            within continuous innovation and imagination. As long as I can keep
            improving myself and staying creative I feel like everything will
            fall into place. I tend to have big ideas initially but I need to
            get myself to a point where I can fully execute those crazy ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The examples I found for good designs were mostly focussed on those
            crazy or innovating ideas too. Some looking more like game menus or
            interactive experiences, rather than standard websites. The bad
            websites had fairly poor UX in common. On those it was hard to find
            specifically what you’d want, hence me putting them on the ‘bad’
            list.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second being a short Coca Cola assignment. Gathering minor data
            on the company and how they partake in market segmentation. This
            being a group assignment we all found the same data initially. I
            mainly focussed on the design of the presentation while others
            gathered most of the data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third presentation was based on different psychological
            philosophies. We were tasked to find examples for each of them. I
            feel like I successfully completed this assignment, finding good
            examples for each principle. Some of the examples from the
            presentation I made are: Path of leasts Resistance (Netflix),
            Perpetual Habit (Youtube), and Magical Number Seven (Coolblue).
