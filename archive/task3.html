            For our third assignment we were tasked to create a single html
            file, with separate CSS files. This was done so we could have a
            deeper understanding on the html and how we could use it in
            completely different ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially it was quite simple. It got gradually harder though once
            new elements were added in and some previously visible ones, had to
            be hidden in a different CSS file. In the end I managed to have
            three complete pages with fairly decent accuracy to the original
            designs. I tried to get the main points of the website correct
            first, which for some of them was a centred letter, for others it
            was text on the sides.
          </p>

            As an added challenge for the week where we won’t have class. The
            objective was to add a button to switch between the different styles
            and CSS. For this I received some help from Rob. Initially I only
            had a switch that would go one way between two of them. But Rob had
            the idea of a counter in there and if statements to go between
            different CSS files. It basically sets the ‘href’ of the CSS link in
            the 'head' to a different CSS file. And it counts up from 0 through
            3 to switch between the files.
