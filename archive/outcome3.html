          <p>
            Design is something I’ve been most focussed on these past few weeks.
            Most of the time I’ve spent in Figma and Illustrator. Figma has
            become pretty easy for me to use and create quick designs with.
            Illustrator has been a bit of a learning curve but I’m quickly
            getting the hang of the basic tools and uses.
          </p>
          <p>
            One key improvement point I have for myself is to draw things more
            often. Currently I start with a quick Figma design instead. Maybe it
            isn’t such a bad thing as I feel like I can convey my own thoughts
            better that way, but maybe it isn’t the right order in doing things.
            This goes for both website designs as well as logo design.
