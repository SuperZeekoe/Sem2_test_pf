        <h1>Logo Design</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            My logo design story started off with a bunch of ideas coming from
            either my gamertag or my last name. Initially I wanted to draw a
            very minimalistic looking manatee. I feel like I succeeded, but when
            I asked people to identify what my logo looked like, they couldn’t
            see anything resembling an animal, let alone a manatee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of that I started looking at other options of designs, going
            to my last name of ‘Lemmens’. This is pronounced as Lemons in
            English so I thought it’d be funny if I maybe created a lemon tree
            out of an ‘L’. This idea didn’t really go anywhere. I tried creating
            a few lemons to go along with my name but nothing looked right, so I
            shelved this idea. I went back to the manatee drawing board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A tip from Robertas was to lower my mouse speed as low as it can go,
            and draw lines that way. So I found a manatee image to draw the
            outlines from for the initial form. After that I tweaked it a bit
            with some accents and shadows and there we go, a clean manatee. I’m
            really happy with the result as it kept my main idea of keeping a
            minimalist approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next up was the typography. I went for SZC, combining my gamertag of
            ‘Super Zeekoe’ and ‘Coding’. After a couple of iterations I found a
            font I liked, now all that was left was colours. In my initial
            portfolio designs I had a few colours as options for accents, one
            being yellow and another option was red. After using them
            individually for the logo, I tried combining them and I instantly
            fell in love. It did however remind of a faction in a videogame
            though, but coincidentally that was my favourite faction in said
            game. I toyed a bunch with drop-shadows and ended up on only using a
            drop-shadow on the C, it felt a bit much if it was on everything.
            The last accent I added was a slight red outer-glow on the C and the
            Manatee to make those two pop a bit more and voila, SZC.
