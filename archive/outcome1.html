            For the first learning outcome I feel like I’ve done the most work.
            During the Christmas break I came across a very cool YouTube
            tutorial for a neat JavaScript effect. I ended up implementing this
            in my portfolio. I’ve searched through multiple different websites,
            trying to find inspiration in colours and UI/UX. Before the semester
            started I was already working on my initial designs for the second
            semester portfolio. Trying different layouts, looks, and colour
            schemes. In these designs I already toyed with some minor logo work,
            but I ended up not using any of these. I did however keep the
            colours I tried out, eventually combining two into my final logo.

            My portfolio website prototypes went through multiple iterations,
            functionality staying the same in each as it was the core of design.
            Most iterations were differences in colours and for some pages they
            were more layout focussed. I feel like I’ve definitely made progress
            on this learning outcome by researching and looking at professional
            websites, gathering inspiration and ideas, and implementing those
            into my own work. Iteration has been the core of this process over
            the past weeks, as I’ve gone through multiple designs, eventually
            landing on one.
