        <h1>Communication</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            This learning outcome has been one of the more consistent ones for
            me. I value good communication and try my best to keep communication
            between everything clear. For the project that means coming up with
            short day plans, to give everyone an idea of the things we have to
            do. I was also the contact person between our project client and our
            group, scheduling the meeting for an interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            With fellow classmates I tend to give and take feedback quite often.
            Mostly sharing ideas with my project group, showing different
            variations on designs, sharing thoughts on the UI/UX of a portfolio
            or general design aspects. For the programming classes I’ve talked a
            lot to Rob in case I wasn’t sure about something JavaScript related.
            I also asked Frank for some feedback when I got stuck on an
            assignment, which then greatly helped me along and got me to the
            point where I could complete the assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            One big improvement I have is to more actively seek our teacher
            feedback. Looking back I feel like I’ve been slightly neglecting it
            unintentionally. Mostly because I feel like I was doing fine
            regardless, but in the future I should reach out more. Even if I’m
            still fine, a bit of feedback never hurts, as there is always
            something to improve upon. I have reached out a few times, regarding
            some coding and some logo design aspects, but I should ask for more
            feedback and help regarding the project and research as I’m less
            confident in those aspects.
