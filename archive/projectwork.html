          <p>
            For the project I’ve taken the de facto leadership role, mostly
            because I want to keep things moving forward and progress. This
            mostly comes down to keeping communication going and trying to
            create a short plan of action every time we’re working on the
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the project plan I’ve worked on the Risk Assessment, planning
            (gantt chart), and deliverables. Besides that I’ve delivered my
            input in the research methods, research main- and sub-questions, and
            the interview. After the initial project plan write-up, I’ve also
            read through it all and edited it where necessary to have a more
            coherent document. During the beforementioned interview I was
            present and taking notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re currently in the process of going through the research methods
            and together with Luc, we’ve done the competitor analysis. We found
            eight different artists/ art collectives websites and started
            writing down what each of them have that makes them stand out. Some
            were more focussed on actually selling art, others were focussed on
            showcasing their creations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design wise we’ve found a wide variety of different style choices,
            ranging from very minimalistic and “luxurious”, to more basic or
            colourful designs. Looking at these websites we found some definite
            no-go’s for our project website going forward and also some things
            we could try to implement ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created a ‘Strengths & Weaknesses’ comparison chart once we felt
            like we collected enough data. The conclusion we came to, was that
            in order for our website to be a success, we’ll need to have the art
            as main view point on the website at all times. Some websites had
            very lacklustre UI/UX, so that is another thing we need to
            thoroughly do user-testing for once we’re at that stage of the
            project. Besides that, Erion seems to have a wide price range for
            his artwork, making it very accessible, which we should showcase as
            well.
