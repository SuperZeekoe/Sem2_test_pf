        <h1>Professional Identity</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            A professional identity is definitely something I feel like I’m
            forming for myself. I consistently have a ton of crazy ideas I might
            want to implement or create a website around. Coming from Semester 1
            where I may have over-asked myself and had to compromise on a lot in
            the end, I intend on taking things a bit slower for semester 2. I
            want to consistently improve bit upon bit on this portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The skeleton frame of the website is there but there are a ton of
            features I would like to implement over the course of the semester.
            Including a sideways scroll function, possible one-page solution for
            all content and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the JavaScript classes we’re getting currently I think a lot of
            these things could become reality in the near future, with a bit of
            creative googling to find others’ ideas and thoughts on possible
            solutions for my self-made problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            A big addition to my identity as a designer is coming from my logo.
            Previously I didn’t have anything regarding a logo but now the
            Manatee is coming to life. Of course it would require some extra
            iterations to become perfect but for now I am extremely pleased with
            myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel myself becoming creative just studying media design and I
            want to keep this going. I write down my ideas more often and keep
            them in my pocket for when I actually want to add them to future or
            current projects. The best change for myself so far has been the
            feedback I received from Josh, and I paraphrase: Rather do something
            simple, perfectly, than doing something outrageous, sloppy.
