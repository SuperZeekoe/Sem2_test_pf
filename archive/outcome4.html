        <h1>Research</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            We’re currently still in the researching phase for our project.
            Together with Luc, we’re currently working on a competitor analysis.
            We are looking at a variety of different artists websites to find
            inspiration, advantage and definite no-go’s. Our current finding is
            that our client has a unique position with his clock art. Besides
            that his use of different shades of white can really set him apart
            from other artists out there currently.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve also worked together with my group on defining our main
            research question as well as sub-questions. Trying to come up with
            well linked questions that can answer our main question. One
            question I came up with for example: How can Erion’s art best be
            used as a basis for a website.
          </p>
          <p>
            This links into our main question “What would a showcase of Erion’s
            portfolio and personality look like, and how can that be
            incorporated into a website?”. If we can answer that sub-question we
            can answer a large part of our main question going forward. Creating
            a design for the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also took part in preparation of and the actual interview with our
            client. For the preparation part I was the contact person between
            our client and our group. I scheduled the meeting and for the
            interview I was there taking notes and starting the recording after
            it was agreed upon. I tried to keep the notes as clear as possible
            for the rest of the group to use. During the interview we noticed
            the client drastically changed his approach from the initial meeting
            at the start of the semester. Mainly in his take on a shop function
            for the website. This is crucial information we’re glad to have
            received through the interview, because without one we wouldn’t have
            known this was now one of his wants.
          </p>

            Another key part of Research has been the UCD assignments, trying to
            find information on different subjects and combining that
            information into a short PowerPoint presentation. For more
            information on these, please click ‘UCD Assignments’.
