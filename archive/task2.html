        <h1>TASK 2</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            The second development task we received was to create a website,
            where every time you’d click on a button, a new and random picture
            of a cat would appear. This would be done with JavaScript in our
            first class on it. The class itself started with making text appear
            upon button click, and gradually moved further into eventually
            making images appear and creating html semantic elements through
            Javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an extra task for a few weeks later, the objective slightly
            changed. We were now tasked with trying to get the images to appear,
            where you’d click with your mouse. To start off with this Frank gave
            us a small piece of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with this small piece of code, and a bit of explanation I
            received previously, I knew I could find what I’d need in the
            console after logging for (e). This gave me the information I needed
            to move forward. I grabbed clientY & clientX, put those into
            variables and used them for changing the CSS of a newly created img
            tag in html.
