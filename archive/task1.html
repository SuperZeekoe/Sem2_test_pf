          <p>
            For our first Front end Development class we got the assignment to
            recreate an existing website. The website in question is
            aircompany.com. The idea was to recreate the initial landing layout
            just from the initial viewpoint. This was relatively easy to do, I
            mainly struggled with putting the things Iâ€™d have to do in order for
            myself to work through. I changed my approach slightly, starting
            with full html content write up first, before adding any CSS. After
            that, I started on the navbar sizing and moved on to the video +
            overlay text. I ended up re-using the same method for layering text
            on a piece of media for my portfolio index page.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel like this task suits learning outcome 2 the most, in creating
            a somewhat proof of concept based on clear predetermined
            requirements (recreating the landing page).
