        <h1>Portfolio Design</h1>
        <section>
          <p>
            My portfolio design started before Semester 2 kicked off. I found a
            really cool tutorial on Youtube, based on a portfolio website of a
            front end developer/designer. The core part being the moving image
            track. After following along with the guide, it didn’t work so I
            dived into the codepen provided and tweaked some things till it
            worked. I’ve added upon it slightly design wise and made the image
            themselves links, as well as layering a centre title on top of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website isn’t completely done yet, there are still numerous
            things I want to improve upon. A side-ways scrolling function, maybe
            a one-pager. But for now I’ve separated everything into different
            pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design wise I’m trying to keep a minimal approach, with accents
            referring to my logo. The colours I’ve chosen are yellow and red,
            with white and dark grey for text/background colour. Going into a
            somewhat calming feeling, with clear visuals. I’m trying to keep
            everything in a size so pages won’t have to be scrolled. Personally
            I prefer it that way, but this is something I want to add upon
            later, making it a more interactive one-pager, so you’d never leave
            the frontpage, but instead content will be brought to the user when
            clicking on a link.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve gone through multiple iterations of design, while keeping the
            initial image-track as the centrepiece. For the content pages I’ve
            gone through multiple looks, with and without background, different
            colour accents, different layouts. In the end I settled on a
            straight forward design, top-down content -> key points -> direct
            links to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I felt like this would be the simplest approach and most clear for
            people visiting the website to find what they need.
